The game is played over 4 betting rounds. The objective of the game is for a player to combine his/her hole cards and/or the community cards to achieve better combinations than the other players.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			At the beginning of the game, the two players to the left of the dealer must place their bets or fold. The first player to the left of the dealer is the Small Blind. The second player to the left of the dealer is the Big Blind. The Small Blind must place his/her stake first, which is half of the minimum stake. The stake of the Big Blinds is the minimum stake. The stakes of the Blinds therefore are automatic. Each of the players then receives two cards (hole cards) face down. The remaining players then place their bets, call or fold, whereby they leave the game. Finally, the &lsquo;flop&rsquo; (the first three community cards) is laid in the middle of the table.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			The second betting round follows, beginning with the first player to the left of the dealer. The players call or check. To &lsquo;check&rsquo; means to pass on the right to open the betting to the next player (clockwise). If, within a round, a player has already made a bet, none of the players after this player may check. Instead they must call, raise or fold. If every player in a round checks, the next card is dealt. The next card is also dealt out when each player has bet the same amount. If a player wishes to raise, he/she must, depending on the game, bet at least double of the Big Blind (e.g. with a Big Blind of 5, the player must bet at least 10).</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			Following completion of the 2nd betting round, the 4th community card, known as &ldquo;Turn&rdquo; is laid on the table. The 3rd betting round follows and is played in exactly the same way as the previous betting rounds. Upon its conclusion, the 5th community card is laid, known as &ldquo;River&rdquo;. The final betting round follows.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			If there are more than two players still in the game at the end of the final round, the game is decided by a showdown, whereby the player with the best 5 card combination wins the game. This combination can be achieved by using the hole cards and/or the community cards. Both, one or none of the hole cards can be used here. If the best combination is formed by using just the community cards, the winnings are equally divided between the remaining players. If the players have the same card combinations, the kicker decides the winner.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			E.g.: Player A has a 5 and a King. There is also a 5 in the community cards. Therefore, the player has One Pair and the King is the kicker. Player B also has a 5 and a Queen. Therefore, player B has One Pair with a Queen as the kicker.

The game runs over two betting rounds. The aim is to achieve the best card combination among the players by exchanging the cards in the hand.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			At the beginning of the game, the two players to the left of the dealer must place their stakes or fold. The first player to the left of the dealer is the Small Blind. The second player to the left of the dealer is the Big Blind. The Small Blind must place his/her stake first, which is half of the minimum stake. The stake of the Big Blinds is the minimum stake. The stakes of the Blinds therefore are automatic. Each of the players then receives five cards face down. The remaining players then place their bets, call or fold, whereby they leave the game. The 1st betting round follows beginning with the player to the left of the dealer. The players bet, call or check. To &lsquo;check&rsquo; means to pass on the right to bet to the next player. If, within a round, a player has already made a bet, none of the players after this player may check. Instead they must call, raise or fold. The players can bet the same amount. If a player wishes to raise, he/she must, depending on the game, bet at least the value of the Big Blind. In higher betting rounds in Fixed Limit games, the minimum stake is higher. In a No Limit game, the minimum amount for a raise is only higher if a player has already bet or raised. The minimum amount for a raise is then the amount that was bet previously, or by how much was raised.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			After completion of the betting round, each player has the opportunity to exchange some or even all of his/her cards. Exchanging the cards, however, is not compulsory. To exchange cards, the player need only click on the unwanted card(s), and then on the button &ldquo;Draw&rdquo;. Should the player not wish to exchange cards, he/she need only click on the &ldquo;Draw&rdquo; button, without selecting any cards beforehand. Alternatively, the player can wait until the move time runs out. The second betting round then follows. Following completion of this round, the results are calculated. The winner is the player who holds the best card combination.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			Following the calculation of results, the role of the dealer, indicated by the letter &ldquo;D&rdquo; in the box of the corresponding player, passes on to the next player in a clockwise fashion.

The game begins with the purchase phase. This lasts 90 seconds. During this time the players can select and purchase the desired number of Bingo cards. Players can buy cards as often as they wish within the given time limit. Each card costs a defined amount. The player&rsquo;s stake is therefore the sum of cards bought, multiplied by the stake per card. A share of the stake is added to the pot, while the rest constitutes the operating fee.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			The draw phase follows. Every player, who has purchased at least one card, takes part in the draw. Only the purchased cards will then be displayed in the playing field. If a player didn&rsquo;t buy any cards for the game, he/she has the opportunity to buy cards for the next round. For the players involved in the game, one number after the next is drawn. The drawn numbers, providing they are shown on the card(s), are marked off. As soon as the round has been won, the winner is announced and the next purchase phase can begin.</p>\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Bingo&nbsp;</strong>is played and loved the world over.

As long as a player keeps potting his/her own balls, he/she may continue playing.&nbsp;<br />\r\n		<br />\r\n		A player commits a&nbsp;<b>foul&nbsp;</b>when&nbsp;\r\n		<ul style="margin: 1em 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px;">\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px -11px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 16px; list-style: outside; background-image: url(http://static2.greentube.com/xsl_gamebase/_gametwist_2010/imgs/bullet_gametwist.png); background-attachment: scroll; background-color: transparent; background-position: 0px 4px; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">\r\n				he/she pots the white ball</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px -11px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 16px; list-style: outside; background-image: url(http://static2.greentube.com/xsl_gamebase/_gametwist_2010/imgs/bullet_gametwist.png); background-attachment: scroll; background-color: transparent; background-position: 0px 4px; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">\r\n				plays no ball or the wrong ball&nbsp;</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px -11px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 16px; list-style: outside; background-image: url(http://static2.greentube.com/xsl_gamebase/_gametwist_2010/imgs/bullet_gametwist.png); background-attachment: scroll; background-color: transparent; background-position: 0px 4px; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">\r\n				pots the black ball prematurely&nbsp;</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px -11px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 16px; list-style: outside; background-image: url(http://static2.greentube.com/xsl_gamebase/_gametwist_2010/imgs/bullet_gametwist.png); background-attachment: scroll; background-color: transparent; background-position: 0px 4px; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">\r\n				less than four coloured balls touch the edges or none are&nbsp;potted during the break&nbsp;</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px -11px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 16px; list-style: outside; background-image: url(http://static2.greentube.com/xsl_gamebase/_gametwist_2010/imgs/bullet_gametwist.png); background-attachment: scroll; background-color: transparent; background-position: 0px 4px; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">\r\n				after the first contact between the white ball and another ball no balls are&nbsp;potted or not even one touches a cushion</li>\r\n		</ul>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			<br />\r\n			The player who&nbsp;wins the foul can place the white ball anywhere on the&nbsp;table and continue playing.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			<b>The&nbsp;aim of the game&nbsp;</b>is to&nbsp;pot your own balls in as few rounds as possible.

The player may then define a number of settings to determine who may join the game, such as the opponents&rsquo; skill level, as well as the number of opponents. The player must decide whether the &quot;Knock&quot; button should be activated during the game. If this button is activated, the players will have the opportunity to take the card laying on the discard pile before the opponent can. The player may then take his/her turn as usual. Lastly, the player may set the point limit for the game, with a choice of 1, 50 or 100 points. 1 means that the game is over after one round. Alternatively, the player may join a game that has been set up by another player.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			A red exclamation mark signifies that it is the player&rsquo;s turn, while a green arrow points at the opponent who is making his/her move.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			The time remaining for the move is shown to the right of the table, as is the agreed maximum point total and other handy buttons such as &ldquo;Player Info.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Invite&rdquo;. The game chat is also located here. The player&rsquo;s own cards are shown face-up and his/her nickname and points total are displayed below. At the top left of the screen are two piles of cards.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			The pile facing upwards is the discard pile, while the other is the deck. A player may take a card from either pile. To do this, the player need only click on the desired card. To lay a card on the discard pile, the player can either click on the unwanted card or drag and drop it onto the pile. Jokers can normally only be laid by using the drag and drop method.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			Each player is shown a blended out &ldquo;Lay Cards&rdquo; button. As soon as the player has formed a group or sequence that can be laid, this button becomes active. The group or sequence that can be laid is highlighted by a blue line that stretches across all of the cards. The laid cards are shown in the middle of the table. To add cards to a group or sequence already laid, a player need only drag and drop the desired card into position. To make the order of the cards clear, a blue arrow shows the ends of the groups and sequences.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			The player has the opportunity to move the cards around in his/her hand. This is possible while other players are taking their turns and can be done by simply dragging and dropping the cards into the desired position.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			At the end of the round the point value of the cards that the player is still holding is shown. The player must then click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;. If the total exceeds the limit set at the start of the game, a red X appears next to the player&rsquo;s name and the button &ldquo;Exit&rdquo; is displayed. Clicking on this button takes the player back to the lobby. If the total is lower than the limit, he/she can click again on &ldquo;Next&rdquo; and join the next round.</p>\r\n		<h3 style="margin: 38px -1px 31px -12px; padding: 0px 0px 4px; font-size: 17px; color: rgb(51, 153, 204); font-style: italic; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: rgb(51, 153, 204);">\r\n			Rules</h3>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			Rommé is a card game for two to four players. It is played with two decks of 52 cards and 6 Jokers. The Jokers can be used to complete groups or sequences. Before the game begins, a point limit is determined. If, during the game, a player exceeds this limit, he/she must sit out the remaining rounds.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			Each player receives 13 cards at the start of each round. The aim of the game is to lay all of the cards in the middle of the table in groups or sequences. At the beginning of a player&rsquo;s turn he/she must first take a card from either the deck or the card discarded by the previous player. Should the player have a recognised group or sequence of cards, he/she may lay it. Finally, the player must discard a card, irrespective of whether a group or sequence was laid. The turn is then over and the next player may go.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			A group consists of at least 3 cards of the same value, e.g. three 10s or four Aces. However, no card may appear twice in the group, meaning that a group of e.g. 10 of Diamonds, 10 of Clubs and 10 of Diamonds is not possible.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			A sequence is a number of consecutive, same suite cards in ascending order, e.g. 8 of Diamonds, 9 of Diamonds, 10 of Diamonds or 10 of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, Queen of Clubs. Aces can be either high or low, however one cannot lay a sequence consisting of a King, Ace and a 2. This is referred to as &ldquo;laying around the corner&rdquo;.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			While a player may lay a set of 3 cards, only one of the 3 may be a Joker. This means that Ace, Joker, Joker, for example, is not a valid combination, as it is unclear as to whether the cards form a group or a sequence.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			A player requires at least 30 points in hand to lay for the first time. If the player holds, for example, three 7s, he/she must wait as this group totals only 21 points. Once the player can lay a group or sequence of at least 30 points in value, the cards go into the middle of the table. Any player, who has already laid once in the round, may then add his/her own cards to the group or sequence already in the middle. E.g. A sequence consisting of 7 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs and 9 of Clubs has already been laid. A player who holds the 10 of Clubs may add this card to the sequence. The Jack of Clubs could then also be added, however the players must take care when a group is concerned as each card may only appear once.</p>\r\n		<h3 style="margin: 38px -1px 31px -12px; padding: 0px 0px 4px; font-size: 17px; color: rgb(51, 153, 204); font-style: italic; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: rgb(51, 153, 204);">\r\n			Hint:</h3>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			If there is a group or sequence laid out on the table that includes a Joker, a player may exchange the card, which the Joker is standing in for, for the Joker itself.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 17px; padding: 0px;">\r\n			As soon as a player has laid all of his/her cards, the round is over.
